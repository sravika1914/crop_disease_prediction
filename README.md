Crop Disease Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict crop diseases using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers in diagnosing crop diseases early, thereby improving crop yield and reducing the reliance on chemical treatments.

Features

- Data Collection: Gather and preprocess data related to crop diseases.
- Model Training:  Train machine learning models to predict diseases based on input features.
- Evaluation:      Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
- Prediction:      Predict the type of disease for new, unseen data.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (or `keras`), `jupyter` (for running the notebook)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter

Usage

1. Clone the Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sravika1914/crop_disease_prediction.git
   cd crop_disease_prediction

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook Crop_Disease_Prediction.ipynb

3. Run the Notebook:
   Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load the data, train the models, and make predictions.

Data

The dataset used for training and evaluation is included in the repository. Ensure that you review and preprocess the data as described in the notebook.

Results

The notebook provides insights into the performance of the models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization of predictions and model performance is also included.
